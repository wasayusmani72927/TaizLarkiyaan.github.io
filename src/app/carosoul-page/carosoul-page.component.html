      <div>These found pages appear to be part of a personal fashion catalogue or a fashion zine. There doesn’t seem to
        be a rigid design or formula these pages follow, but the composition of the elements on the pages (text as well
        as images) is free-flowing. We see an amalgamation of hand-drawn elements coupled with whimsical illustrations
        that document sketched ideas, prototypes, and inspirations.
      </div><br>
      <div>The choice of paper, jute paper, reveals how self-sufficient as well as environmentally safe the society is,
        where creators and consumers are mindful of what they create and share in respect to their surroundings. This
        mindfulness is also captured and communicated through the materiality as well as the creative genius specified
        through these pages. We find great insight in these pages, into the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the space.
        We may dissect how these pieces belong to a world where people use their emotions to identify themselves, and
        feelings play a pivotal role in not only fashion but their personal and collective identities; such as
        communicated through the text complementing the “Handcuff Illustration” where the design tries to “illustrate
        their insecurities and the journey of their personal growth”. </div><br>
      <div>Moreover, the depiction of the human body in these drawings is very fluid. The artists who have worked on
        these designs and drawings, do not appear to be looking at the human body through a gendered lens. We do not see
        any particular gender binaries pertaining to the garments they wear or the accessories they adorn themselves
        with; the accessories themselves employ recycled materials and their iconography consists of patterns, rhythm
        and forms found in nature and the organic world.</div><br>
      <div>The prose-like text we read entails how these decisions and creative inspirations are not restricted to any
        particular individual’s visual language or a personal lexicon but they are a reflection of the society’s
        collective vernacular. </div><br>
      <div>The text in the background as well as the personalized notes reveal their peoples’ ability, and perhaps,
        ambition to transform while being seamlessly woven together, continuously creating, nurturing, giving, and
        receiving. The colours and patterns seem to honour their collective beliefs as well as their ties to the natural
        world, where the inhabitants ‘adorn themselves with nature’s gifts and scribble memories across our bodies’. The
        softness of the material, as presented in the zine, the folds of the fabric, and the fluidity present in figures
        allude to organic bodies and structures- like the ocean which swells and falls. This zine, although perhaps a
        mundane object from this alternate world, offers itself as an heirloom or a historical record; preserving the
        customs, values, and inspirations of the people of this world.</div>
